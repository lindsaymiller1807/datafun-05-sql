> Professional Python and SQL project analyzing library book review data.
> This project compares average review ratings across book genres using related tables.

This project uses Python, pandas, SQLite, and SQL to analyze related library data.
The books and reviews tables are connected using `book_id`.

The analysis calculates the average review rating for each genre and displays the
results in a bar chart.

## Motivation

We've mostly worked with data stored in files.
Organizations often keep larger collections of related data in databases,
where we can ask for the information we need
instead of loading everything at once.

In this project, we'll use SQL to ask questions of data stored in a database.
We'll select useful records, filter and organize results,
summarize groups, and combine related information
so it can be used in further analysis.

## This Project

This project uses **relational data, SQLite, SQL, Python, and pandas**
to analyze library book review data.

The analysis uses two related tables:

- **books** — contains book information such as title, genre, branch, and pages
- **reviews** — contains review ratings linked to books using `book_id`

The project asks:

**How does the average review rating compare across book genres?**

SQL joins the books and reviews tables, groups the results by genre,
and calculates the average rating for each genre.

The results are then visualized with Python using a bar chart.

## Produced Artifacts

## Produced Artifacts

This project produces several useful outputs:

- **Genre Rating Chart** — `docs/images/first-chart.png`
- **SQLite database** — generated from the library CSV files
- **Project log** — records the steps and results from each program run

## Library Genre Rating Analysis

![Average Review Rating by Genre](docs/images/first-chart.png)

This analysis compares the average review rating across six book genres using data from the books and reviews tables.

Mystery had the highest average rating at 3.62, while Fiction had the lowest at 3.14. Overall, the average ratings were fairly close across all six genres.

## Important Folders and Files

- **data/*** - raw CSV input files
- **artifacts/** - generated database files, logs, or reports
- **docs/** - project narrative and documentation
- **src/datafun/** - project logic
- **zensical.toml** - update documentation site metadata

## Common Workflow

Follow the
[step-by-step workflow guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/workflow-b-apply-example-project/)
carefully.

## Challenges

Challenges are expected.
Sometimes instructions may not quite match your operating system.
When issues occur, share screenshots, error messages,
and details about what you tried.
Working through issues is part of implementing professional projects.

## Success

After completing Phase 1. **Start & Run**, you'll have the example project,
running on your machine.
A new file `project.log` will appear in the root project folder
and running the example script will print out:

```shell
===================================
END main() - Executed successfully!
===================================
```

## Command Reference

The commands below are used in the workflow guide above.
They are provided here for convenience.

Follow the guide for the **full instructions**.

<details>
<summary>Show command reference</summary>

### In a machine terminal (open in your `Repos` folder)

Open a machine terminal in your `Repos` folder,
change directory (cd) into the new folder,
and run `code .` to open only this example project in VS Code:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/denisecase/datafun-05-sql

cd datafun-05-sql
code .
```

### In a VS Code terminal

These are listed for convenience.
For best results, follow the detailed instructions in
[pro-analytics-02 guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/).

Use VS Code menu option `Terminal` / `New Terminal` to open a **VS Code terminal**
in the root project folder.
Copy each command, paste into your terminal, and hit ENTER,
to run each command one at a time.

```shell
uv self update
uv python pin 3.14
uv python install
uv lock --upgrade
uv sync

uv run pre-commit install
uv run pre-commit autoupdate

git add -A
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
# repeat if changes were made by pre-commit tasks
git add -A
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# run the Python module
uv run python -m datafun.app

# run marimo nb as a reactive app
# press Ctrl + C in the terminal to exit
uv run marimo run src/datafun/notebook.py

# Or: run marimo nb as a notebook
uv run marimo edit src/datafun/notebook.py

# do chores
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run ty check
uv run python -m pytest
uv run python -m zensical build

# save progress as you work
git add -A
git commit -m "your message here"
# repeat if changes were made (try the UP ARROW)
git add -A
git commit -m "your message here"

git push -u origin main
```

</details>

## Helpful Tips

- Use the **UP ARROW** and **DOWN ARROW** in the terminal
  to scroll through past commands.
- Use `CTRL+f` to find (and replace) text within a file.

## Much Can Be Ignored

- You do not need to add to or modify `tests/`.
  Tests are recommended and provided for example only.
- Many files are silent helpers.
  [Explore](https://denisecase.github.io/professional-python-project-explainer/)
  as you like, but most files are never touched.
- You do NOT need to understand everything;
  let understanding build over time.

## As Needed

If VS Code does not automatically use the new `.venv` environment:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
2. Run **Python: Select Interpreter**.
3. Select the interpreter from this project's `.venv` folder.

If VS Code still does not recognize the environment or newly installed tools:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
2. Run **Developer: Reload Window**.

## Troubleshooting >>>

If you see something like this in your terminal: `>>>` or `...`
You accidentally started Python interactive mode.
It happens.
Press `Ctrl c` (both keys together) or `Ctrl+Z` then `Enter` on Windows.
